# ionic-cordova

Useful hooks to be included in Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework, and Phonegap projects

### Requirements

* Node Package Manager (NPM)
* Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework, or Phonegap

### Overview

This is a collection of hook scripts to help improve the build process of your mobile application.  It is a good idea to 
use scripts that you need, rather than everything found in this repository.  Blinding using everything found in this 
repository could lead to undesired results.

### How To Use

Each script in this repository is found in its recommended directory.  If a script is found in the `before_prepare` directory, 
then it is recommended you place it in the `hooks/before_prepare` directory of your project.  However, you can choose to do 
whatever you want.
